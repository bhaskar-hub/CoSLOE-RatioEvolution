# SRPS-RatioEvolution
In selective RNA processing and stabilization (SRPS) operons, stoichiometry of encoded
proteins is determined by their respective 3’-end stem loops (SLs), yet evolution of this mechanism
remains elusive. In cellulosomal operons of Clostridium spp., the orthologous SLs and their
associated genes drift separately during evolution, with their phylogeny poorly correlated. However
the SL-sequence-based tree and composite SL-∆G-based (CoSL) trees are both more similar to the
organismal-function-based tree, than the 16S-rRNA tree and the associated-gene-based tree,
suggesting selection of these SLs by the ecological niche of organism. This is the case for 80% of
the orthologous SRPS operons genome-wide. Based on ∆G of such SLs, we propose CoSLOE
(Composite SL-based Operon Evolution) with evolutionary ratio (ER) >1 or <1 for positive or
negative selection of SRPS operons. In the CoSL-tree of cellulosomal operons, when traversing
from leafs to the root nodes, ERs reveals diversifying/positive selection towards a less efficient
cellulosomal system, consistent with glycoside-hydrolase gene variation both in-operon and
genome-wide. A similar pattern is followed by the ATPase operon and the majority of orthologous
SRPS operons genome-wide, suggesting conservation among operons in such selection. Thus SRPS
operons via their transcript-stabilizing non-coding elements are a proxy of niche selection,
highlighting a link between operon stoichiometry and organismal adaptation.
